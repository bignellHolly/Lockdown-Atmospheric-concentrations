# Lockdown-Atmospheric-concentrations
Analysis of the differences of changing concentrations of atmospheric NO2, NO and O3 (more commonly known as ozone) at two locations in the UK (Marylebone and Headingly) over the period of 2020.

Aims: 
•	Determine if the variation of concentrations of these atmospheric constituents are as a result anthropogenic contribution, by analysing the change during lockdown in 2020. 
•	If proven to be anthropogenic, to what extent to these contributions affect the concentrations of the constituents?
•	What are the effects of the change in concentrations of NO2, NO and O3?
•	Visualise and present the results as an infographic aimed towards non-experts.
